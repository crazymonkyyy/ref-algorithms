reference algorithms

impliment a self contained a algorithms lib that only covers the 3-core-function algorithms, has no overloads, has no template helpers, design tradeoffs are numbered, pure and lazy even in cases where real code wont want that, no specailizations for basic types even for the easy cases like min or balencedperns.

Pure thoery so I can make some god damn progress solo

liencenced under the yet to be written "monkyyy is smrt" linence where users must admit monkyyy is right and let me make one major design decision
